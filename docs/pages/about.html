                    <p>Hi, I'm Mia, a game programming generalist and creative technologist. My passion lies in bringing ideas to life through innovative gameplay and immersive experiences. With a solid foundation in game programming, I've spent the last 5 years honing my skills in gameplay programming, AI development, level design, 3D modelling.</p>
                    <p>After earning my degrees in Games Technology BSc (Hons) from Coventry University and Game Studies and Engineering MSc from Alpen-Adria Universität Klagenfurt, I’ve landed my first “grown-up” job as an Assistant Lecturer in Games Technology at Coventry University. This allowed me to continue my learning journey, not only developing further my technical skills but also sharpening social skills.</p>
                    <p>My portfolio includes work on various game jam projects, of which most notable are <b><a href="https://miamohac.com/projects/esc2.html" target="_blank">Esc 2</a></b> and <b><a href="https://miamohac.com/projects/hoovin-forward.html" target="_blank">Hoovin’ Forward </a></b>. Also, due to the need for never-ending learning and knowledge, I’ve went through the Skills Bootcamp in Video Game Development where I worked as a part of a team to create a vertical slice of a project named <b><a href="https://miamohac.com/projects/peasant-post.html" target="_blank">PeasantPost</a></b> (please don’t let RoyalMail know about this).</p>
                    <p>My creative process is rooted in a deep love for creation and a commitment to pushing the boundaries of what games can be. I believe that games are a powerful medium for expression and connection, and I’m constantly exploring new ways to create immersive experiences and tell a story through the art.</p>
                    <p>Outside of work, I’m a board game aficionado, outdoor enthusiast, and I love discovering new games that challenge conventions. I also enjoy anything that allows me to express myself through creativity such as painting (both through traditional and technical mediums), pottery and sewing.</p>
                    <p>Creativity is at the core of who I am—I need to create to thrive. Continuous learning fuels my passion, as my mind is always eager to explore and absorb new knowledge. Overall, I consider that my creativity is my inner fire, and learning is the fuel.</p>
                    <p>While colleagues and friends often see me as an extrovert, I also identify with introverted qualities, making me a bit of an ambivert. Labels aside, I'm adaptable and enjoy connecting with others—so if you're easygoing, we'll get along great!</p>
                    <p>If you’re interested in working together or just want to talk shop, don’t hesitate to email me on <b>miamohac.official at gmail dot com</b> or through <b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/miamohac/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></b>. <b>Let’s create something amazing together!</b></p>

                <p>An innovative and engaging game developed for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/the-gdg-jam/rate/2629010" target="_blank">THE GDG JAM (#1) üïπÔ∏è</a>, themed "Forward." Players take on the role of a robotic vacuum cleaner tasked with the mission to clean an entire apartment, including walls and ceilings. The game challenges players to manage time and battery life efficiently while ensuring every corner of the apartment is spotless.</p>

            <h1>Description of the game</h1>
            <p>In Hoovin' Forward, the primary objective is to clean the apartment thoroughly. As the player maneuvers the robo vacuum across the floors, they leave a trail of cleanliness behind, indicating progress. Players must navigate the environment while balancing a limited battery life and a strict time constraint, adding a layer of strategic planning to the gameplay.</p>
            <p>A successful run is determined by the player's ability to clean every surface before the battery runs out or time expires, leading to a game over if the player fails to manage these resources effectively.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="small-divider"></div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <h1>Gameplay Mechanics</h1>
            <p>Players control the robotic vacuum using WASD keys, navigating around obstacles and cleaning various surfaces. The movement mechanics are straightforward, yet the challenge lies in optimizing the cleaning path while trying to avoid damaging household objects.</p>
            <p>The game offers a rewarding experience as players must think strategically about their route to ensure all areas are cleaned efficiently.</p>

            <h1>Challenges and Achievements</h1>
            <p>The primary challenge during development was the 48-hour time limit imposed by the game jam. Despite this, our team managed to deliver a functional and engaging game that met the theme's requirements.</p>
            <p>The tight timeline pushed us to think creatively and work collaboratively, resulting in a game that was both fun to play and technically sound.</p>

            <h1>Team Contributions and Collaboration</h1>
            <p>Our development team consisted of five members. One team member was responsible for creating the 3D model of the Roomba, while three others focused on programming the gameplay logic and UI functionality. My role involved designing the game level using assets from the Unity Store, developing the clean trace shader, and designing the game icon.</p>
            <p>We utilized collaboration tools like Miro and Trello for project planning and task allocation, ensuring a smooth workflow and effective communication among team members.</p>

            <h1>Challenges and Achievements</h1>
            <p>Developing "Esc 2" presented a significant challenge due to time constraints. Despite having several days for the game jam, my teammate and I were juggling full-time work commitments, which limited our development hours. A classic challenge we faced was balancing the game's progression and difficulty, ensuring that players could enjoy steady upgrades without the game becoming too easy or difficult.</p>
            <p>This required us to implement and test various enemy behavior patterns and upgrade pricing structures under tight deadlines. Our biggest achievement was completing a functional and enjoyable game within 72 hours, which received positive feedback from the gaming community for its creativity and unique concept. It was immensely rewarding to see "Esc 2" recognized for its engaging gameplay and innovative take on the theme.</p>

            <h1>Team Contributions and Collaboration</h1>
            <p>The success of "Esc 2" was a testament to effective collaboration. My primary responsibilities were in 3D art and level design, as well as the creation of 2D UI elements and character design. Meanwhile, my teammate took charge of programming, handling gameplay mechanics, and integrating scores with the leaderboard system.</p>
            <p>We communicated frequently to ensure that the visual and technical components of the game were seamlessly integrated. This collaboration allowed us to create a cohesive game that balanced visual appeal with technical functionality, demonstrating our ability to work effectively as a team under pressure.</p>

            <h1>Personal Contributions</h1>
            <p>In the development of Hoovin' Forward, my primary responsibilities included the following:</p>
            <ul class="custom-list"><b>Level Design:</b> I designed the game levels using existing assets from the Unity Store, ensuring a cohesive and engaging environment for players.</ul>
            <ul class="custom-list"><b>Shader Development:</b> I created the clean trace shader using Unity's Shader Editor and programmed its logic using C#. This involved developing a system that dynamically updated the floor's material to show cleaned areas in real time.</ul>
            <ul class="custom-list"><b>Art and Effects:</b> I designed the game icon using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop and created visual effects, such as explosions and smoke, when the vacuum runs out of battery.</ul>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <h1>Technical Challenges and Solutions</h1>
            <p>One of the main technical challenges was developing an accurate cleaning trace. Initially, the shader was not updating correctly, causing the clean trace to appear in the wrong spots.</p>
            <p>To solve this, I explored the transform vectors (size, position, rotation) of the floor object and ensured the updates were correctly applied. This solution involved continuously feeding material updates into the shader, which ultimately resolved the issue and improved the game's performance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="small-divider"></div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <h1>About the shader</h1>
            <p>A key aspect of the game was the shader that depicted the cleaned areas. Stuart Heath developed a tool that generated textures of the traversable ground using a raycast system.</p>
            <p>This tool created a mask on the floor where objects obstructing the raycast left a black value, while open floor spaces were left white. I then developed a shader that continuously updated the floor material texture using this information, ensuring a realistic representation of the cleaning process throughout gameplay.</p>

            <h1>Future Improvements or Features</h1>
            <p>There are several exciting ideas for enhancing Hoovin' Forward in future updates. We plan to introduce:</p>
            <ul class="custom-list"><b>Docking Station:</b> A feature for charging or swapping batteries, adding an extra layer of challenge. Players can unlock upgrades that allow battery swapping for prolonged gameplay.</ul>
            <ul class="custom-list"><b>Sack-Emptying Station:</b> Similar to battery swapping, players can empty or swap the vacuum‚Äôs storage sack. As the sack fills, cleaning efficiency decreases, increasing the likelihood of making a mess.</ul>
            <ul class="custom-list"><b>Upgrades and Advancements:</b> Improvements in speed, reliability, battery life, and the ability to clean previously uncleanable substances like liquids. Additionally, ultraviolet vision to reveal hidden dirt for an added gameplay twist.</ul>
